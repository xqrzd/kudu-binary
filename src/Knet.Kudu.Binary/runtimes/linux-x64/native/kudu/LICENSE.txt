      "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
      Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
      copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
      (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

      "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
      the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
      to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
      submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
      or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
      the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
      means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent

      designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."

      "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
      on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
      subsequently incorporated within the Work.

   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
      as of the date such litigation is filed.

   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
      meet the following conditions:

      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
          stating that You changed the files; and

      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
          the Derivative Works; and

      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
          as modifying the License.

      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
      the conditions stated in this License.

   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

================================================================================

The following dependencies or pieces of incorporated source code have licenses
under one of the following categories:

  (a) do not require their license text to be re-distributed with binary
      distributions (e.g. Boost license)

  (b) have no requirements about re-distributing their license text in either
      source or binary distributions (e.g. public domain)

  (c) require inclusion of the license text in both source and binary distributions,
      but are used only at build-time and thus not incorporated in binary artifacts
      (e.g. BSD- or MIT-licensed build tooling)

  (d) are the same Apache 2.0 license reproduced in its entirety above.

Therefore, we do not reproduce their licenses in their entirety in this file.

License information for Kudu third-party dependencies
==========================================================

This directory contains scripts which download and install several third-party
dependencies of Kudu. In production builds of Kudu, most of these dependencies
are statically linked into the Kudu binaries, while in the Kudu binary test
jar, some of these libraries are distributed as dynamically-linked shared
objects. A few of these dependencies are used only at build time and are noted
as such.

  non-exclusive license:

  (a) under intellectual property rights (other than patent or trademark)
      Licensable by such Contributor to use, reproduce, make available,
      modify, display, perform, distribute, and otherwise exploit its
      Contributions, either on an unmodified basis, with Modifications, or
      as part of a Larger Work; and

  (b) under Patent Claims of such Contributor to make, use, sell, offer
      for sale, have made, import, and otherwise transfer either its
      Contributions or its Contributor Version.

  2.2. Effective Date

  The licenses granted in Section 2.1 with respect to any Contribution
  become effective for each Contribution on the date the Contributor first
  distributes such Contribution.

  2.3. Limitations on Grant Scope

  The licenses granted in this Section 2 are the only rights granted under
  this License. No additional rights or licenses will be implied from the
  distribution or licensing of Covered Software under this License.
  Notwithstanding Section 2.1(b) above, no patent license is granted by a
  Contributor:

  (a) for any code that a Contributor has removed from Covered Software;
      or

  (b) for infringements caused by: (i) Your and any other third party's
      modifications of Covered Software, or (ii) the combination of its
      Contributions with other software (except as part of its Contributor
      Version); or

  (c) under Patent Claims infringed by Covered Software in the absence of
      its Contributions.

  This License does not grant any rights in the trademarks, service marks,
  or logos of any Contributor (except as may be necessary to comply with
  the notice requirements in Section 3.4).

  2.4. Subsequent Licenses

  No Contributor makes additional grants as a result of Your choice to
  distribute the Covered Software under a subsequent version of this
  License (see Section 10.2) or under the terms of a Secondary License (if
  permitted under the terms of Section 3.3).

  2.5. Representation

  Each Contributor represents that the Contributor believes its
  Contributions are its original creation(s) or it has sufficient rights
  to grant the rights to its Contributions conveyed by this License.

  2.6. Fair Use

  This License is not intended to limit any rights You have under
  applicable copyright doctrines of fair use, fair dealing, or other
  equivalents.

  2.7. Conditions

  Sections 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, and 3.4 are conditions of the licenses granted
  in Section 2.1.

  3. Responsibilities
  -------------------

  3.1. Distribution of Source Form

  All distribution of Covered Software in Source Code Form, including any
  Modifications that You create or to which You contribute, must be under
  the terms of this License. You must inform recipients that the Source
  Code Form of the Covered Software is governed by the terms of this
  License, and how they can obtain a copy of this License. You may not
  attempt to alter or restrict the recipients' rights in the Source Code
  Form.

  3.2. Distribution of Executable Form

  If You distribute Covered Software in Executable Form then:

  (a) such Covered Software must also be made available in Source Code
      Form, as described in Section 3.1, and You must inform recipients of
      the Executable Form how they can obtain a copy of such Source Code
      Form by reasonable means in a timely manner, at a charge no more
      than the cost of distribution to the recipient; and

  (b) You may distribute such Executable Form under the terms of this
      License, or sublicense it under different terms, provided that the
      license for the Executable Form does not attempt to limit or alter
      the recipients' rights in the Source Code Form under this License.

  3.3. Distribution of a Larger Work

  You may create and distribute a Larger Work under terms of Your choice,
  provided that You also comply with the requirements of this License for
  the Covered Software. If the Larger Work is a combination of Covered
  Software with a work governed by one or more Secondary Licenses, and the
  Covered Software is not Incompatible With Secondary Licenses, this
  License permits You to additionally distribute such Covered Software
  under the terms of such Secondary License(s), so that the recipient of
  the Larger Work may, at their option, further distribute the Covered
  Software under the terms of either this License or such Secondary
  License(s).

  3.4. Notices

  You may not remove or alter the substance of any license notices
  (including copyright notices, patent notices, disclaimers of warranty,
  or limitations of liability) contained within the Source Code Form of
  the Covered Software, except that You may alter any license notices to
  the extent required to remedy known factual inaccuracies.

  3.5. Application of Additional Terms

  You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support,
  indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered
  Software. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on
  behalf of any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear that any
  such warranty, support, indemnity, or liability obligation is offered by
  You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify every Contributor for any
  liability incurred by such Contributor as a result of warranty, support,
  indemnity or liability terms You offer. You may include additional
  disclaimers of warranty and limitations of liability specific to any
  jurisdiction.

  4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation
  ---------------------------------------------------

  If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this
  License with respect to some or all of the Covered Software due to
  statute, judicial order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with
  the terms of this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b)
  describe the limitations and the code they affect. Such description must
  be placed in a text file included with all distributions of the Covered
  Software under this License. Except to the extent prohibited by statute
  or regulation, such description must be sufficiently detailed for a
  recipient of ordinary skill to be able to understand it.

  5. Termination
  --------------

  5.1. The rights granted under this License will terminate automatically
  if You fail to comply with any of its terms. However, if You become
  compliant, then the rights granted under this License from a particular
  Contributor are reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until such
  Contributor explicitly and finally terminates Your grants, and (b) on an
  ongoing basis, if such Contributor fails to notify You of the
  non-compliance by some reasonable means prior to 60 days after You have
  come back into compliance. Moreover, Your grants from a particular
  Contributor are reinstated on an ongoing basis if such Contributor
  notifies You of the non-compliance by some reasonable means, this is the
  first time You have received notice of non-compliance with this License
  from such Contributor, and You become compliant prior to 30 days after
  Your receipt of the notice.

  5.2. If You initiate litigation against any entity by asserting a patent
  infringement claim (excluding declaratory judgment actions,
  counter-claims, and cross-claims) alleging that a Contributor Version
  directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then the rights granted to
  You by any and all Contributors for the Covered Software under Section
  2.1 of this License shall terminate.

  5.3. In the event of termination under Sections 5.1 or 5.2 above, all
  end user license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers) which
  have been validly granted by You or Your distributors under this License
  prior to termination shall survive termination.

  *  Covered Software is free of defects, merchantable, fit for a        *
  *  particular purpose or non-infringing. The entire risk as to the     *
  *  quality and performance of the Covered Software is with You.        *

  *  (not any Contributor) assume the cost of any necessary servicing,   *
  *  repair, or correction. This disclaimer of warranty constitutes an   *
  *  essential part of this License. No use of any Covered Software is   *
  *  authorized under this License except under this disclaimer.         *

  *                                                                      *
  ************************************************************************

  8. Litigation
  -------------

  Any litigation relating to this License may be brought only in the
  courts of a jurisdiction where the defendant maintains its principal
  place of business and such litigation shall be governed by laws of that
  jurisdiction, without reference to its conflict-of-law provisions.
  Nothing in this Section shall prevent a party's ability to bring
  cross-claims or counter-claims.

  9. Miscellaneous
  ----------------

  This License represents the complete agreement concerning the subject
  matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be
  unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent
  necessary to make it enforceable. Any law or regulation which provides
  that the language of a contract shall be construed against the drafter
  shall not be used to construe this License against a Contributor.

  10. Versions of the License
  ---------------------------

  10.1. New Versions

  Mozilla Foundation is the license steward. Except as provided in Section
  10.3, no one other than the license steward has the right to modify or
  publish new versions of this License. Each version will be given a
  distinguishing version number.

  10.2. Effect of New Versions

  You may distribute the Covered Software under the terms of the version
  of the License under which You originally received the Covered Software,
  or under the terms of any subsequent version published by the license
  steward.

  10.3. Modified Versions

  If you create software not governed by this License, and you want to
  create a new license for such software, you may create and use a
  modified version of this License if you rename the license and remove
  any references to the name of the license steward (except to note that
  such modified license differs from this License).

  10.4. Distributing Source Code Form that is Incompatible With Secondary
  Licenses

  If You choose to distribute Source Code Form that is Incompatible With
  Secondary Licenses under the terms of this version of the License, the
  notice described in Exhibit B of this License must be attached.
