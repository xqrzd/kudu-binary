This archive contains Kudu binaries for use in a "mini cluster" environment for
TESTING ONLY.

The binaries in this archive should never be deployed to run an actual Kudu
service, whether in production or development, because many security-related
dependencies are copied from the build system and will not be patched when the
operating system on the runtime host is patched.
